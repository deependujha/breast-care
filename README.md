# Breast-Care
This project was made for **'Hackfest'** a hackathon organized by **['CodeDamn'](https://codedamn.com/)**. We, **"Fate Twisters"**, a team of three undergrads, [Amit Kumar Mahato](https://github.com/weaponxwolf), [Deependu Jha](https://github.com/deependujha), and [Nitesh Kumar](https://github.com/niteshKrr) took part in this hackathon and did our best to complete this project in 36 hours (even less than 2 days).
<br/>
Our project is about the **Breast Cancer**. Breast Cancer is at the second position in all deaths due to cancer. It is very much ignored in India. Even if a woman feels pain in her breasts, she feels uncomfortable in consulting a doctor immediately.
<br/>
The project is regarding, others/ people who suffered or went through the horrific cancer motivating other fighters to not to give up their fight with cancer. People can share their experience, read about experiences of others, and also read about what is breast cancer, how it affects the body, how deadly it is and other FAQs. A logisitics regression model has also been used to predict whether the details given for a cell may be potentially affected by breast cancer or not. Though, we strictly emphasize not to take it seriously, and must consult doctor in any case.

**Your health is what matters most for us, not our model or project.**
